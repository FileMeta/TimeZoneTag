# TimeZoneTag
TimeZoneTag is a class for representing the timezone offset associated with a DateTime metadata field. The class has methods for parsing a timezone metadata tag, formatting a tag, and for converting between UTC and local time.

The software is distributed in C# as a [CodeBit](http://filemeta.org/CodeBit.html) located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FileMeta/TimeZoneTag/master/TimeZoneTag.cs). It is released under a [BSD 3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) open source license.

TimeZoneTag is part of the [FileMeta](http://www.filemeta.org/) initiative because it manages a particular type of metadata field.

This project include the master copy of the [TimeZoneTag.cs]() CodeBit plus a set of unit tests which may also serve as sample code.

TimeZoneTag does not depend on any other CodeBits.

## About CodeBits
A [CodeBit](https://www.FileMeta.org/CodeBit.html) is a way to share common code that's lighter weight than NuGet. Each CodeBit consists of a single source code file. A structured comment at the beginning of the file indicates where to find the master copy so that automated tools can retrieve and update CodeBits to the latest version.
